There was a man sitting in a barn!
He drank a lot, seeing as his only daughter had passed away recently due to her chronic battle with drug addiction and cancer:D
The only place she could be treated was Stanford University. 
When he found out there could be a cure, his heart jumped with joy. 
It was an amaamzing, magical time where there could only be place for joy. 
But this false hope was quickly vanquished and destroyed when, the cancer had violently affected every part of her body, making every part her body effectivley dead.
It was that kind of day.
